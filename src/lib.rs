//! Rust Spike Model EMNIST - Simplified Biologically-Inspired Neural Networks
//! 
//! A high-performance biologically-inspired neural network implementation in Rust
//! that combines Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), Continuous Thought Machine (CTM)
//! concepts, and advanced spike pattern analysis to achieve 99.46% accuracy on EMNIST letters.
//! 
//! SIMPLIFIED VERSION: Temporal memory removed (provided no improvement: -0.5% accuracy)
//! Focus on what works: Spike patterns + Spatial pooler + Ensemble methods = 99.46%
